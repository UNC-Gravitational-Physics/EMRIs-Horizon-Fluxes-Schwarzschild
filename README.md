High-order PN expansions for the energy and angular momentum absorbed by the central black hole for eccentric-orbit EMRIs (2023)

This repository contains the expansions of the energy and angular momentum absorbed at the central horizon for Schwarzschild EMRIs to 22PN (or 18PN relative to the leading horizon flux), as a supplement to the paper arXiv:.  Apart from the lowest order terms given in closed form, the terms through 10PN horizon-relative are provided to 20th order in eccentricity, and the remainder through 18PN are provided to 10th order in eccentricity. The series can be loaded by using Mathematica’s Get[] function, for example Get[“EHorizon18PN”].  A demonstration is provided in the loadSeries.nb notebook.
